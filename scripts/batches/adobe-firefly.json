  "summary": "Adobe Firefly is Adobe’s generative AI service for creative work across images, text effects, and increasingly video and audio—accessible on the web and inside flagship apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe Express, and Premiere Pro. Firefly’s Text to Image tool supports prompt-based synthesis, style presets, structure/sketch guidance, and content editing operations (e.g., Generative Fill/Expand in Photoshop). Firefly emphasizes commercially safe usage for enterprises and transparency controls; Adobe states that Firefly image models are trained on Adobe Stock, openly licensed content, and public-domain materials, and also provides a credit-based usage system across web and mobile experiences. Recent product updates expanded Firefly to mobile and introduced access to third‑party models (e.g., OpenAI, Google) from within the Firefly app, while keeping Creative Cloud workflows and asset handoff intact.\n\nTypical uses include campaign concepting, social visuals, product shots, mood boards, and rapid iteration of design directions before moving into pixel‑perfect editing. Firefly integrates with Libraries, Brand Controls (via Express and CC), and Photoshop’s non‑destructive layers so creatives can mix AI‑generated assets with manual retouching and vector composition. Teams adopt Firefly to accelerate ideation while maintaining brand safety and license clarity, and many organizations value the indemnification available on qualified enterprise plans. Migration is straightforward for existing Adobe customers: enable Firefly in the browser or within supported apps, allocate credits to teams, and apply governance policies consistent with Creative Cloud.\n\nFirefly is best for designers, marketers, and content teams already working in Adobe—especially where handoff to Photoshop/Illustrator/Express is essential and organizations want model provenance and enterprise guardrails.",
