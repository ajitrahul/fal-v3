  "summary": "GitHub Copilot is GitHub’s AI coding assistant that surfaces code suggestions, test generation, inline explanations, and repository-aware chat directly in the IDE and on GitHub.com. It is available in three principal tracks—individual (Copilot Free, Pro, and Pro+), organizational (Copilot Business), and enterprise-wide (Copilot Enterprise)—with governance capabilities that matter in regulated, multi-team environments. Copilot integrates natively with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and GitHub’s web UI, and augments the pull request and issue workflows with features like PR summaries, test authoring, and issue drafting. \n\n\nFor organizations, Copilot adds admin guardrails, including content exclusion so you can centrally declare files or paths that Copilot must not read for context, as well as auditability to review changes to exclusion policies. Spend governance is built-in via request allowances and premium request monitoring so admins can track and cap higher-cost requests. Copilot’s security posture benefits from GitHub’s platform controls and SSO/SAML integration when used under Business or Enterprise. \n\n\nTeams standardize adoption through GitHub’s published playbooks and measurement guides, which outline how to pilot Copilot in controlled cohorts and quantify productivity impact over time. Customer stories document outcomes at scale—for example, large enterprises reporting improved developer satisfaction and faster delivery after centralizing development on GitHub and enabling Copilot. Enterprises can upgrade organizations from Copilot Business to Enterprise using documented steps, and manage plan changes—upgrades, downgrades, or billing cycle changes—at the organization or enterprise level. \n\n\nCopilot’s differentiators include its deep embedding in GitHub flows (pull requests, Issues, CLI), enterprise-grade policy controls, and continual investment in the “coding agent” that can tackle scoped development tasks from Issues. Copilot is best for engineering teams that already use GitHub and want AI assistance that is repository-aware, policy-governed, and measurable, with an adoption path that scales from individual developers to fully governed enterprises.",
