  "tagline": "AI coding assistant with deep codebase context",
  "summary": "Sourcegraph Cody is an AI coding assistant designed to understand large, multi-repo codebases and deliver context‑aware help: code generation, refactoring, test authoring, code explanations, and repository‑wide Q&A. It layers on top of Sourcegraph’s code intelligence platform and Code Search, giving Cody the ability to reason over extensive code graphs and organizational standards. In practice, Cody helps engineers write code faster, reduce time spent searching, and maintain consistency by grounding responses in actual repositories—including monorepos spread across code hosts.\n\nTeams adopt Cody in IDEs (VS Code and JetBrains) and in the browser alongside Sourcegraph’s UI. Organizational features span SSO, repository and permission awareness, and centrally managed configurations. Sourcegraph publishes customer stories across industries, including public sector and enterprises with strict security requirements; case studies highlight faster incident response, accelerated onboarding, and improved test coverage when Cody is paired with Sourcegraph Code Search. For teams moving toward autonomous development, Sourcegraph positions its agentic tooling (e.g., Amp) to execute multi‑step tasks such as large‑scale edits or feature implementations, while Cody continues to power day‑to‑day assistance with a strong understanding of code context.\n\nCody is best for organizations that already use (or are adopting) Sourcegraph for code intelligence and want an assistant that truly “knows” their codebase. Migration is straightforward: deploy Sourcegraph, connect code hosts, roll out the Cody IDE extensions, and scale with enterprise governance. Sourcegraph’s documentation and training playlists cover installation, configuration, and usage patterns for JetBrains and VS Code, while customer stories provide concrete reference architectures and adoption outcomes.",
