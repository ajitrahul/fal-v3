  "summary": "Codeium is an AI coding assistant and the maker of the AI‑native IDE Windsurf. Codeium’s extensions and Windsurf provide inline code completion, chat grounded in project context, multi‑file edits, unit‑test generation, and agentic workflows (e.g., Cascade) that plan and apply changes across files. The platform emphasizes “context‑aware everything,” describing how real‑time repository context improves suggestion quality and reduces rework. Enterprise offerings focus on privacy and control; public materials discuss Cloud and Hybrid (VPC/on‑prem) options and a government track, with content describing FedRAMP High alignment and DoD IL5/ITAR considerations for regulated buyers.\n\nCodeium/Windsurf publishes multiple customer stories on its blog, such as DRW and Zillow, describing adoption paths, onboarding acceleration, and measurable impacts in development velocity. Migration patterns are straightforward: individual developers can start free with the Windsurf editor or IDE plugins, then upgrade to paid plans for higher usage and team features. Organizations can roll out Windsurf/Codeium centrally, integrate SSO, and choose between secure SaaS, private cloud, or hybrid deployments documented in enterprise materials. Tutorials and product walkthroughs are available on the Windsurf YouTube channel, covering feature releases (“Waves”) and integrations with leading frontier models.\n\nCodeium is best for teams that want an AI‑first editor experience (Windsurf) with agentic assistance and strong context handling. Enterprises evaluating on‑premises or government‑grade deployments should review the enterprise/government pages and request security documentation for private installations and data‑handling details.",
