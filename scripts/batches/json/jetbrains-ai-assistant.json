  "summary": "JetBrains AI Assistant brings AI‑powered code completion, in‑editor generation, chat, unit‑test creation, and explanations into JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, Rider, and others). It is designed around the way developers work inside JetBrains editors, with AI actions available contextually from the editor, gutter, and tool windows. Documentation covers getting started, licensing, and activation, and includes IDE‑specific guides that show how to use AI Assistant for refactoring, version control workflows, database tools, terminal commands, and more.\n\nJetBrains materials highlight expanding model support and the ability to use certain local models for selected features, while enterprise customers can manage access and usage centrally with JetBrains account/organization tooling. The official YouTube playlists demonstrate practical workflows and “tips & tricks” sessions across languages and frameworks, and the JetBrains Guide collects articles and videos showing everyday patterns for AI‑assisted development in the JetBrains ecosystem.\n\nJetBrains AI Assistant is best for teams already on JetBrains IDEs that want native, discoverable AI functionality without switching editors. Migration typically involves enabling the AI Assistant plugin, obtaining/assigning licenses, and rolling out organization‑wide policies. For teams with strict policies, JetBrains documents configuration, data handling, and options to experiment with local models for specific operations.",
