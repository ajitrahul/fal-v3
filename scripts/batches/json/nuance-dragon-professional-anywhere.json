  "summary": "Dragon Professional Anywhere (DPA) is a cloud-hosted dictation solution for professionals who need fast, accurate speech recognition across desktop applications. It supports custom vocabularies, auto‑text, and voice commands to insert boilerplate or trigger workflows. IT admins centrally manage user access and settings, and organizations can combine DPA with Dragon Anywhere Mobile for smartphone dictation.\n\nDPA is used in legal, public sector, and enterprise documentation, improving productivity for report writing and form completion. Licensing is subscription-based, and deployment involves installing the lightweight dictation client and distributing configuration profiles.\n\nDPA is best for organizations standardizing on Nuance for non-medical documentation with centralized administration.",
