  "summary": "Runway is a creative production platform centered on its Gen-3 and Gen-4 model families for controllable video, image, and multimodal generation. Gen-4 focuses on consistent character and scene generation across shots, style control, and a set of references (subject, style, and scene) that improve continuity in multi-shot sequences. Production teams use Runway in two modes: Credits Mode for faster, higher‑limit generations and Explore Mode (Unlimited plan) for relaxed, credit‑free experimentation on supported tools. Purchased credit packs never expire, while monthly plan credits refresh on billing day and do not roll over. \n\n\nTeams adopt Runway for a range of tasks—storyboards, B‑roll, character consistency tests, product shots, expressive characters, lip sync, interpolation, upscaling, and more. The platform provides detailed use-case guidance through Runway Academy (tutorials and AMAs) and customer stories from film, TV, commercial, and creator workflows. Self‑service Enterprise plans pool monthly credits across a workspace and include annual billing, allowing multiple editors/admins to share a credit allowance and collaborate with governance. \n\n\nRunway documents subscription management clearly: upgrades between plans are prorated, downgrades apply to the next cycle, and credit behavior is predictable (monthly plan credits reset on billing day; purchased credits persist; one-time free credits stay until used). Unlimited plan subscribers can generate in Explore Mode with per-user rate balancing and switch to Credits Mode for faster generation or for tools not available in Explore Mode. \n\n\nRunway’s differentiators are its film‑first creative tooling (e.g., references for consistency), a rapidly updated Academy, and transparent credit mechanics suited to both solo creators and studios. It fits best where creative control and iteration speed matter—music videos, trailers, commercial spots, and emerging episodic content—while Enterprise credits and governance make it workable for team pipelines and budget oversight.",
