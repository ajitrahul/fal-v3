  "summary": "Bolt.new is StackBlitz’s AI‑powered web development agent that lets you prompt, run, edit, and deploy full‑stack applications directly from the browser. The open‑source codebase is published by StackBlitz, and the official tutorials walk through creating new projects, importing existing repositories, iterating with prompts, and deploying to production without local setup. Because it runs on StackBlitz’s WebContainers and cloud infrastructure, Bolt can start servers instantly, run package managers, and present a live preview as you and the agent iterate. \n\nGetting started is as simple as opening bolt.new, selecting a starter, or describing an app in natural language. You can refine the output with follow‑up prompts, open a file tree to make targeted edits, and ask the agent to handle routine tasks like wiring routing, auth, or styling. For teams, Bolt helps create prototypes, reproduce issues, or share minimal repros quickly. Migration typically involves importing an existing project via GitHub or ZIP, then using Bolt’s agent to refactor or add features before exporting or deploying. \n\nBolt is best for browser‑first development where speed and shareability matter—hackathons, proofs of concept, tutorials, and demo‑driven workflows. Since the project is open source, developers can review the code and extend the agent for custom workflows; the official YouTube channel provides short, practical lessons on prompting tips and deployment patterns.",
