  "summary": "Azure Neural Text‑to‑Speech is part of Azure AI Speech, providing natural‑sounding neural voices, SSML controls, and custom voice training (with consent) for enterprise applications. Developers synthesize speech via REST/SDKs, stream audio for real‑time use, and configure pronunciation with lexicons. Azure exposes granular controls for speaking style, role play, and emotions in supported voices, and enterprise customers can enforce identity and access policies across subscriptions.\n\nTypical applications span IVR systems, accessibility and screen readers, interactive assistants, and multimedia e‑learning. Azure provides pay‑as‑you‑go pricing with free tiers and offers regional availability for compliance needs. Documentation covers quickstarts and deployment patterns using Functions, Kubernetes, or App Services; event logging and monitoring integrate with Azure Monitor. \n\nAzure Neural TTS is a strong fit for organizations standardizing on Microsoft cloud services that want high‑quality voices, customization options, and enterprise governance.",
