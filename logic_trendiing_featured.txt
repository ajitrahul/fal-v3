### **Logic for "Featured" and "Trending" AI Tools**

This document outlines the criteria and logic for categorizing AI tools on your website's homepage.

#### **I. "Featured" Tools**

* **Definition:** These tools are strategically chosen by the website owner to be prominently displayed. Their selection is based on business goals and strategic value.
* **Selection Process:** Manual and periodic (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).
* **Criteria for a Tool to be "Featured":**
    * **Monetization:** The tool is part of an affiliate program or a paid partnership. (Priority: High)
    * **Newness/Innovation:** The tool is a recent addition to the website and offers a unique or novel solution. (Priority: Medium)
    * **Quality of Listing:** The tool's listing on the site is complete, with high-quality descriptions, images, and video demonstrations. (Priority: Medium)
    * **Expert Recommendation:** The tool has been endorsed by a trusted figure in the AI industry. (Priority: Low)

#### **II. "Trending" Tools**

* **Definition:** These tools are automatically identified as gaining a significant surge in popularity over a recent, short period. Their selection is purely data-driven.
* **Selection Process:** Automated script or function that runs at a regular interval (e.g., daily or hourly).
* **Criteria for a Tool to be "Trending":**
    * **Data Points to Track:**
        1.  `view_count`: Number of page views in the last 7 days.
        2.  `click_through_rate`: Clicks from homepage/category pages in the last 7 days.
        3.  `new_saves_count`: Number of times the tool has been "favorited" in the last 7 days.
        4.  `new_reviews_count`: Number of new reviews added in the last 7 days.
* **Logic (Example Algorithm):**
    1.  Fetch the data for all tools for the past 7 days.
    2.  Calculate a "Trending Score" for each tool using a weighted formula. Adjust the weights to prioritize certain metrics.
        * `Trending_Score = (0.5 * view_count) + (0.3 * click_through_rate) + (0.2 * new_saves_count)`
    3.  Sort all tools in descending order based on their `Trending_Score`.
    4.  The top 5-10 tools from this sorted list are automatically flagged as "Trending" and displayed on the homepage.
    5.  This process should run daily to ensure the list is always fresh and reflects current user behavior.
